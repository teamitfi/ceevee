# ðŸš€ AWS CDK - Infrastructure for Ceevee

This module creates Ceevee CloudFormation stack using AWS CDK:
- A **Cognito User Pool** for user authentication.
- A **User Pool Client** for app-based authentication.
- Outputs for **User Pool ID** and **App Client ID**.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
